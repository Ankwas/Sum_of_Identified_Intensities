Sum Of Identified Intensities is a python program to calculate the modification procentage of a modification site in a mass spectrometry file.

The program takes 6 inputs <br />
The input file for the program is a xml file from an X!Tandem search <br />
The amino acid sequence of intrest is the modification sites that are being investegated ex. NTT for an N-linked glycosylation <br />
Mass of modification of intrest is the mass of the modification, 0.989Da for a deamidation or 2.989 for a deamidation in 180 water <br />
Minimum hyper scor is the minimum hypersoce (a quelety messure of X!Tandem searches) for spectras to be included <br />
Minimum expect score is a quelety messure for spectras to be included <br />
Percision for y- and b- ions is the percision of the instrument the mass spectrometry have been done on<br />
